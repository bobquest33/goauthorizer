#Go Authorizer
- Is a simple way to deal with authentication and authorization layer.
- Is compatible with the go stdlib's http package
- Is not going to ask you to bend your model to fit its needs
- Has nothing to do with oauth. Sorry. :)

Write your own authentication function, write an authorization function (just a tiny something that validates that a user has access to a resource), and you're good to go!

See the example app!
